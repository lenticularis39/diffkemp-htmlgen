# diffkemp-htmlgen

Tool for generating human-readable HTML from DiffKemp YAML output.

## Usage
The tool takes a directory containing YAML files generated by DiffKemp and a
directory where it will put the generated HTML files.

By default the diffs generated by DiffKemp are printed in the original diff
format. Optionally C syntax highlighting or converting the diff to a graphical
form can be applied (applying both at the same time works, but multiline
comments are currently not supported in this mode).
